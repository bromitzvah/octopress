The 4 date rule says, go on at least 4 date with a girl before you get her emotinally attached to you. Not because you want to know her better, but because you want to make sure she isn't a psyco who would start contacting your friends/relatives/siblings for asking them to convince you OR telling them what a jerk you are, once you decide to dump her.
